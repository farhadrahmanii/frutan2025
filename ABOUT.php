            <h2>ALIBABA FRUTAN</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Graduated from Kabul University in Media &
                Arts, Kabul, Afghanistan,
                like any other young man growing
                up in war torn Afghanistan, Alibaba Frutan had his own challenges and fulfillment. From an early age
                he had an irresistible pull towards the world of visual media production and the journey wasn’t
                easy. From 2007 he started his jaunt and had the opportunity to produce various categorized films
                for different organizations which included documentaries, short films, and television commercials.
                Alibaba Frutan’s vision as a visual media professional is to make audiovisual documentation on the
                subject of girls’ education. He thinks it is imperative that an educated girl can educate an entire
                generation. Born in the city of Wardak in Afghanistan, he had witnessed in close quarters the total
                lack of proper legislation on girl child education. The second come back of the Taliban has
                therefore raised serious concerns about the future of education, especially for girls. As per the
                report of UNICEF, an estimated 3.7 million children are out-of-school in Afghanistan – 60% of them
                are girls. For the last three years, he has been following the unparalleled work of WEL and its
                immense contribution towards women empowerment especially for the country of Afghanistan. Alibaba
                has
                made a short feature film; titled The Dark Future. The film is based on a real-life story in a very
                challenging situation. He has dedicated the said film to WEL to create awareness among the citizens
                of Australia and to raise funds for plights of Afghan women. In his 15 years journey in the realm of
                media production, he can contribute his expertise and skills as the media ambassador for WEL. Under
                the capable leadership of Mrs. Rita Anwari, Founder and President of WEL, he is ready to associate
                himself towards offering his expertise..</p>
